Part 1:
  Question #1:	
	@rocfang
	(a)line 22: cpuid_print()
  	(b)line 23: e820_print()
  Question #2:
	@rocfang
	memory address of main is at addr=37008
	No, GDB work with virtual addresses intead of real addresses
Part 2:
  Question #3:
	@rocfang
	xk maps both kernel and user-application into the same address space so that the kernel's system call code can directly refer to user memoy. Thus, imporve performance. 
  Question #4:
	@rocfang
	user malloc: Finds enough memory in user address memory for the Header.
	kernel kalloc: Finds the first available page in real physical memory and allocates it. Also, it asks for and releases lock for security.
  	user prinf: Prints to a given file directory.
	kernel cprintf: Prints to the console.
  Question #5:
	@rocfang
	First excuted code is vector64 () at kernel/vectors.S:317, push $0
  Question #6:
	@rocfang
	176 bytes
  Question #7:
	@rocfang
	#0  sys_sleep () at kernel/sysproc.c:54
	#1  0xffffffff80105008 in syscall () at kernel/syscall.c:170
	#2  0xffffffff8010564d in trap (tf=0xffffffff80157f50) at kernel/trap.c:39
	#3  0xffffffff801058f7 in alltraps () at kernel/trapasm.S:20
